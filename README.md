# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
Python project that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to automate attendance taking in classrooms or workplaces. The program captures live video of individuals entering a room and uses OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to detect and extract facial features from the video frames. The extracted features are then passed through a pre-trained machine learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to recognize and identify individuals. The program records the attendance data in a database and generates reports that can be easily accessed and shared. This system eliminates the need for manual attendance-taking, making it faster, more accurate, and more efficient.
